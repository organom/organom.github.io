I ended up selling my Anycubic Kobra 3 Combo and getting a second Bambulab P1S Combo.

The switch has made everything much easier, allowing me to print parts for the same projects in parallel while maintaining consistently high-quality, reproducible results.

With the increased printing capacity, I also had to expand my dry filament storage since four boxes were no longer enough! (more on this soon)
