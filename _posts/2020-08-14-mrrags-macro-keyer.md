Finally got some free time to build the Mr.Rags Macro Keyer kit ( [http://wb7fhc.com/order-mr-rags-now.html](http://wb7fhc.com/order-mr-rags-now.html) ) I was gifted a while back (thanks Zeev). 
Was actually my first electronic kit built from scratch so it was a build, learn and improve soldering skills (still a long way to go for me) kind of situation. Followed the great assembly videoÂ [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqoL2q9cGMw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqoL2q9cGMw) and everything went ok, ended up working at the fist try :)

My ts100 soldering iron seem to have some defect, since its now almost impossible to read whats on the screen and it felt like the heat on it was not stable anymore, i guess I need to get another one
