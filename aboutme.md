Hi, I’m Ricardo Gomes (aka organom).

I'm passionate about technology, research, prototyping, and sharing ideas. I see myself as friendly, dynamic, and highly motivated—always striving for excellence in everything I do.

What drives me the most is creating something new, especially when it has the potential to help others.

In my free time, I enjoy diving into DIY projects, exploring emerging technologies, and sharing knowledge. My interests span by a wide range of fields, including quadcopters, VR, 3D printing, IoT, and electronics.
I tend to be quite spontaneous about it, often jumping between different projects as inspiration strikes.

Joining hackathons & maker/DIY events is also something I enjoy doing from time to time

I keep track of my personal achievements in this page and my professional ones in LinkedIn.
