Graphically it looks fancy but on terms of functionality seems quite limited&hellip; No visible way to code directly on the device&hellip; it has some tutorials though and it seems you can remote deploy from VS (or at least was what I understood).</p><p>Will give it another try when I have some more time (this time after reading some tutorials in order to find the “Microsoft way” to it).</p>
