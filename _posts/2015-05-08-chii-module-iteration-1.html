<p>The 1st iteration of the chii module. This was a project to build a car pc that never ended up connected to the car since the car screens in the time were really expensive&hellip; But well, we managed to use it after the 1st iteration, for about one year in Poland as server machine + wifi sharing in our students room :D Â It was hilarious passing with it by the airport security guys ;)</p>
