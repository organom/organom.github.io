at the lab. Outside from the awesome projects, 3d printing, electronic hacking and building, I managed to get <a class="tumblelog" href="http://tmblr.co/m9dsmpSVheaOLiGJqqQ6feQ">t4rwin</a> old copter as my first approach to a self built copter.Â </p><p>With a lot of help from master Liviu we made it work, crash (inside), work, crash (outside) and work again :D</p><p>Lots of more improvements planned for it already ;)</p>
