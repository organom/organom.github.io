I can fit lots of small things in the jars, see them and access them easily. Having the light over the main area of the shelve comes in hand for searching screws and gives a general nice look to it. The price of this was around 10-15€ since I mainly used materials I already had laying around, the main price was the drawer slides, light switch, wood and screws.</p><p>The other improvement was some supports for electrical wire rolls. For this I 3d printed the supports, attached them using some screws and used a round wood bar to hang the spools. Additionally I also tried some small 3d printed spools for some extra wiring storage. </p>
