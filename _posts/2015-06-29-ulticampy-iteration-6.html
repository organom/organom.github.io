<p>A lot of hours went into the printer this weekend, basically redoing and remaking parts that should have already been done. Added aluminum tape to the bottom of the cork (decided that better safe than sorry). Realigned (using ultimaker axis align tool from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:715901) and stretched the belts x,y axis and connected some more cables on the electronics.</p>
<p>In the end, nothing really visible, but it had to be done.</p>
