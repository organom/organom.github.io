Time for an update on the Anycubic Kobra 3 Combo

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/posts/2024-12-20-anycubic-kobra-3-combo-update/01" %}

Since the Anycubic Kobra 3 Combo arrived, it has been working hard, mostly printing [Gridfinity](https://gridfinity.xyz/) bins and stands. 

In total, it’s printed for around 696 hours and used about 22kg of filament. 

On the bright side, all this printing allowed me to reorganize and improve both the storage and accessibility of my tools in the office.

A recent upgrade I made was adding the [Yoopai cover](https://www.amazon.es/-/pt/dp/B0CKNZ27ZR), which helps maintain better temperature control during prints, reduces dust, provides more light, and helps with the redirection of the air extraction.

Of course, there have been a few hiccups along the way. 

For example, I dealt with nozzle clogging (the initial Kobra 3 nozzles had a known nozzle defect, but Anycubic’s support sent a replacement head). 

I also had some filament debris block the Ace Pro sensor, preventing the loading and unloading of filament. Thankfully, Anycubic’s support team was fantastic, helping troubleshoot and resolve the issue quickly.

While I still enjoy using the Anycubic Kobra 3, since receiving the BambuLab P1S, I’ve been using it less and less. I’m actually considering selling it and purchasing another P1S to complete my 3D printing setup. 

At the end of the day, the print quality, ease of use, and overall reliability of the BambuLab P1S just outshines the Kobra 3. Although the Kobra 3 is an incredible machine for its price range, I’d rather invest in another P1S and avoid juggling different spare parts, manuals, service and print results.
