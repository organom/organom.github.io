<p>This time I managed to finish some foot and top coverages (both the same design), this allows a better protection of the wires, more stable structure and no dust setting on the inside of the rails. Additionally I also added some covers for the side of the print bed, for the same motives as above, unfortunately the black spool ended after the second, will eventually print the 3rd one once the new black spool arrives.<br/>
Outside from that I printed a new electronics holder and simple fan support.</p>

<p>Next things in the list are: connecting raspberry zero without using the USB cables (direct soldered connection), auto bed leveling and some lights for the printing ( maybe infra red since I have a noir cam).</p>
