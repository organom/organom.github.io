It’s been a while since my last update, and life here in Portugal continues to unfold.

I’ve recently revamped my office space, making it more efficient and inspiring to work in. 
In addition to that, I’ve been taking full advantage of the beautiful mornings with daily walks along the beach. 

Over in the garage, I’ve set up a dedicated space for electronics and components storage, creating the perfect environment for some hands-on creativity.
