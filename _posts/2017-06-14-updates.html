<p>So long time has passed and I didn’t post anything, no worries, lots of cool stuff still happened, I was just got lazy and didn’t post anything. I’ll try to change that in the future (starting by posting some of the things in more detail).</p>
<p>So fast forward since the last post, Mumalab change place, my company changed place, some trips, snes controller arcade with a raspberrypi zero w, winter depression, Love Hackathon #2, AEC Hackathon, got some quadcopter equipment, changed my place (got some garden and a hobbyist flight field nearby), buying and building furniture (still doing so), 7hack Hackathon, got an anycubic delta plus, Futurelab Hackathon. All of course while still making sure to keep doing good progress at work.</p>
