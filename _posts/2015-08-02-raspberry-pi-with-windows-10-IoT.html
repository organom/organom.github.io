<p>Giving a try to Windows IoT 10 for Raspberry Pi 2. </p>
<p>It's a shame that the initial setup is not more “standard” and users have to rely on the IoT Microsoft tools. Graphically it looks fancy but on terms of functionality seems quite limited&hellip; No visible way to code directly on the device&hellip; it has some tutorials though, and it seems you can remotely deploy from VS (or at least was what I understood).</p>
<p>Will give it another try when I have some more time (this time after reading some tutorials in order to find the “Microsoft way” to it).</p>
