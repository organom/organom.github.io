Hey everyone! Just wanted to share a few fun and super useful 3D prints I’ve made recently. I've been spending a bit more time with my printer lately, and it's always satisfying to create something that’s either handy or just plain fun. Here are a few of my recent favorites:

### 🧰 [Junction Box Plus Mini](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1279064-junction-box-plus-mini)

This little box is deceptively simple but incredibly useful. I’ve used it for organizing small electronics projects and hiding away cable messes. The print came out clean, and the snap-fit lid works beautifully. Feels like something I’ll be printing more of for future projects.

### 📏 [Folding Ruler Holder (17mm Gridfinity)](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1043018-folding-ruler-holder-17mm-wide-gridfinity)

Finally—my folding ruler has a proper home! This Gridfinity-compatible holder is a perfect addition to my growing collection of workshop organization prints. Snaps into my grid system like a charm and keeps things tidy.

### 🦕 [Cute Knitted Stegosaur](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1075640-cute-knitted-stegosaur)

Ok, this one is just for fun. It looks like it’s been hand-knitted, but it’s all printed in PLA! Super fun little dinosaur that’s earned a spot on my shelf—and also a few compliments from friends. If you’ve got kids or just want something whimsical, give this one a go. The author has a full set of dinosaurs and other animals

### 🔩 [SuperSerter – Threaded Insert Press](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1306631-superserter-100-printable-threaded-insert-press)

This is a game-changer for working with threaded inserts. It gives you solid control and even pressure—no more crooked or half-sunk inserts. It’s a fully printable tool that just works. If you do any kind of functional printing, this is a must-have.

### 🎮 [Steam Controller Dock](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1336705-steam-controller-dock)

Last but not least, I finally gave my Steam Controller a proper home. This dock fits perfectly, has a clean look, and just adds that touch of order to my gaming setup. Love how it turned out.

That’s it for now! 
If you’ve printed any of these, let me know how they turned out for you—or if you’ve got recommendations for other cool models, I’m always on the lookout. Happy printing!
