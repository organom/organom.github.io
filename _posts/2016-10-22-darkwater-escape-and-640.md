Latest kickstarter buy arrived today :)
2 great boards (Escape + 640) and a 9DOF expansion from DarkWater.io
Basically the 640 it's a DC and Stepper motor control board connectable to the raspberry pi  and the Escape a control board for brushless motors. The 9DOF is a expansion board with 3 axis accelerometer, 3 axis magnetometer and 3 axis gyroscopes that can be fit in either the 640 or Escape board.
