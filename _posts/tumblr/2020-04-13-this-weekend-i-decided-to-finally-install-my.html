In the way I also updated to the latest Marlin 1.1.9.1 and finally got that first layer working nicely. I mainly followed the great video from  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G8GdNywsUQ&amp;t=237s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G8GdNywsUQ&amp;t=237s</a><br/></p><p>Along the way, I had a weird issue that sometimes the probe would fail and printer would start to go up until it hits the endstops. I later realized that this was caused by the cabling that in some head positions was shorting the cables.</p><p>Another issue I had, was that the autoleveled seemed to be setting the head way to close to the bottom, making it not able to extrude the first layer. Followed the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF6ZGKOuzhY&amp;t=279s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF6ZGKOuzhY&amp;t=279s</a> and checked for the real Delta_Height, then added it to the firmware.</p><p>Added a fork of the marlin software with my configuration here <a href="https://github.com/organom/Marlin-1.1.x">https://github.com/organom/Marlin-1.1.x</a> :)<br/></p>
