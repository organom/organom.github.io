It’s an anycubic delta plus, and here in Germany you can even get it via amazon same-day delivery ;)</p><p>The quality of the parts are good and they seem to have made good choices from the materials to the overall construction. The instruction manual is very good, all parts are labelled and there are also videos available of the full assembly process in their youtube channel. It’s definitely a kit I can advise and totally worth the price tag.</p><p>Its working stable with almost zero calibration (only the main center z axis point) but I’ll definitely be loosing some more time to calibrate it properly and print some improvements found on thingy verse.</p><p>Just as an additional information the full build took me around a full day, so I would say between 8-12h and don’t forget to get some blue tape if you don’t want to waste the awesome logo sticker they sent you (was also advised not to use it because it sticks too much).</p>
