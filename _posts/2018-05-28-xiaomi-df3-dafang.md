Another great product from Xiaomi - DF3 dafang camera
Got this one from GearBest for $27.99 - [https://www.gearbest.com/ip-cameras/pp_693217.html?wid=1433363](https://www.gearbest.com/ip-cameras/pp_693217.html?wid=1433363) ( search the internet for some coupons, there are always some available for GearBest ).
So, what makes this one so special? 360 horizontal degrees by 93 vertical degrees of rotation freedom, light sensor, Night Vision with 6 IR Leds, micro sd card slot and 1 usb port, wifi, full hd quality, motion detection, microphone, speaker, single power source of 5v (usb powered), 120 degrees view angle and of course, sweet design.

But wait, is that all? well not really, 1st most important part is that it can be hacked and the 2nd most important part is that it was already done and you can now run a custom linux on it. 
Checkout my friend git repo for instructions on it: [https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks](https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks)
