<p>After the awesome bed leveling of last week, I decide to finally start a big print, when i realized the hotend fan was having cabling issues (would stop working in some head positions). <br/></p>
<p>Time to pick my tools again and do another small fix. Gladly I had one last 12v 0.55A fan that was of the same size as the Anycubic one.</p>
<p>One of the things i get from this fix is that Iâ€™m loving more and more my ts100 soldering iron, its just amazing the speed and the quality it archives, highly recommended :) <br/></p>
