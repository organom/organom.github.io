All the stuff was already there (great job guys), we now just need to organize everything and set it up again&hellip; Lots of possibilities :)</p><p>As sound was somehow already implemented, sort of, next step had to be the fridge :)</p><p>We used the opportunity to try to make the customizations (done during the last year) look more professional and integrated, so basically hide the cables, boards and power supplies in the fridge interior area and wired them all to the main powersource :) Â Great teamwork and really nice quick project :)</p>
