<p>Yesterday finally got the last pieces to finalize the PC build. <br/></p><p>The remaining 2 ram memories (for a total of 64Gb), now finally fitting below the fan, extra 1tb SSD and some Artic P12 PWM fans (to cover for the
 BeQuiet fan that went to the cooler). <br/></p>
<p>Artic P12 PWM  are very impressive fans for the price. I would say they are as quiet or quieter than the Silent Wings 3, and can go until 1800 rpm, moving some serious amount of air, very impressive. They are definitely at the level of Noctua or BeQuiet fans, for a fraction of the price (5 fans cost like 25 bucks).  <br/></p>
<p>If I didn’t own already the other BeQuiet fans, I would equip this build fully with the Artic P12 fans.</p>
