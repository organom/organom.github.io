Today I finally managed to get some free time to install the new tenis ball feet on the printer. All in all I like the result, printer is higher from the ground, less noize and vibration and no fear to scratch the floor xD 
Since I was already with it, also used the opportunity to add a fan protection, security first, right xD
Also got my new esp32 devkitc delivered, so will be having some fun in the coming days ;)
