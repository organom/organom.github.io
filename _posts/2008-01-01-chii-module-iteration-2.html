<p>At the time, I managed to get some more money aside from the university life and it was time to buy some more stuff. Voom 2 car pc case, some car connectors, and well, had also to create a project manual.</p>
<p>The connector seen in top of the manual, allowed to connect my laptop charger (with a button to power on and off), with later a car plug being also added to allow the direct connection to the car.</p>
