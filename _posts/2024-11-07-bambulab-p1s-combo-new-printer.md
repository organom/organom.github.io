After spending already so many hours printing with the Anycubic Kobra 3, I felt it was time to expand my little 3D printing corner with another machine

CoreXY printers have always been my favorite: compact, portable, and known for their solid build quality and ease of maintenance.

Since Anycubic doesnâ€™t currently offer a CoreXY option, I decided to explore the renowned BambuLab printers to see what all the buzz was about. After some research and price comparisons, I selected the P1S.

The hype surrounding these printers is absolutely justified, they truly live up to the reputation.

The only downside? The lack of a filament dryer on the AMS, which would have been a great addition to an already impressive machine.
