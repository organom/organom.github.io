It was about time for an upgrade to my 3D printing setup! My new printer, the Anycubic Kobra 3 Combo, has just arrived. 

It features a 250x250x260mm build area volume, fast printing speed until 600mm/s and multi-color printing with the ace pro, that can dry the fillaments while printing ( [more info](https://store.anycubic.com/products/kobra-3-combo) ).

With this new addition, I'm hoping to dive deeper into the hobby and achieve high-quality prints without having to spend too much time tinkering with the machine.
