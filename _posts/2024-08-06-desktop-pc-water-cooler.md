I’ve been hearing a lot of buzz about the [ARCTIC Liquid Freezer III 240](https://www.arctic.de/en/Liquid-Freezer-III-240/ACFRE00134A) and when I found it at such a great price on Amazon, I couldn’t resist. I decided to grab it and make the final upgrade to my desktop PC.

The build quality is solid, and it’s incredibly quiet compared to my old setup. Plus, it provided an improvement in CPU cooling, dropping the temperature by a couple of degrees, which is always a win.
