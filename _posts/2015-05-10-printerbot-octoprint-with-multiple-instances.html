<img src="/assets/posts/2015-05-10-printerbot-octoprint-with-multiple-instances/01.jpg"/><br/>All set and connected<br/><p>In the lab we needed a machine to connect our 3d printers to octoprint in order to be able to access them via a web browser. There was a cool mini-itx ion board (QuadCore Atom 1.6Ghz) laying around on the free to use area, and I had the aluminium case and the car psu (6-24v input) from my old chii module plus a 2 x HP 2Gb ddr2 800 ECC from my old pc laying around.</p><p>For now it was already tested with 3 printers working simultaneously and the hardware is barely being pushed.
