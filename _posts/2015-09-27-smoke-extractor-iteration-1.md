Was in a urgent need of a smoke extractor after some bad experiences with home soldering. So it was time to pick some parts I had lying around and make something useful out of them.
Inverted the original psu fan to suck the air in, added 2 smaller fans to the back to force the air out, added some kind of filtering (yes... i know... it was what I had lying around...), a switch and a power plug for the 12v dc adaptor
Nothing too sophisticated or perfect, but it gets the job done :)
