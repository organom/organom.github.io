<p>Finally decided to start my own hydroponic
deep water vegetable culture at home. Managed to find that cute vases that seem to fit my purpose and hold allot of small vegetables in a small space. Made some holes with a soldering iron and then the big question arrived: how to hold the vases to the box??  duct tape that sh***!!!   And it actually worked out better than expected :D</p>
<p>Now lets see them grow :D</p>
