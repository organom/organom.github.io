title: About me
---

My name is Ricardo Gomes (aka organom)
I love technology, researching, making prototypes and sharing ideas.
I characterize myself as being friendly, passionate, spontaneous, dynamic, organized and a hardworking person that always strives for excellence.

Creating something new, specially if it can help someone, is my main motivation.

On my free time I enjoy building things (DIY), researching into new technologies, sharing knowledge and playing online games. I tend to be quite spontaneous about it and my attention is spread across a wide range of interests (Quadcopters, VR, 3d printing, IoT, Electronics, etc) and I sometimes write about them on my blog.

Joining hackathons & maker/DIY events is also something I enjoy doing from time to time

Languages are another part of my life, not as a hobby but mainly because life pushed me in that way. I can speak and write well in Portuguese, English & Spanish. My French & German are basic and my Polish and Japanese very basic.

I keep track of my personal achievements in this page and my professional ones in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardocarneirogomes/).
