Currently I have it running AstroPrint, but before I had it with OctoPrint and works as good.</p><p>Second was the built of a spool holder inside an ikea samla 22l box (lots on this in thingyverse) and I have to say I really like the idea. It gives me an easy way to have all the spools together and usable, dust and humidity free and to transport them safely around. Next improvement on this will be connecting the box with the printer via PTFE tube, just waiting for the parts to arrive.</p><p>I did some other improvements but they are are not that worth mentioning. </p><p>Lastly but not least, I would like to share a link to one of the most awesome designs I printed lately - “Ikea Samla Clip. The best one

”  https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2110134 - believe them, they are that good, I already printed 24 during the weekend ;)</p>
