Had some time left on the weekend to work on the PSU. 

After talking to some friends they advised me on going for one of this PSU kits (that will allow the regulation of the volts and amps) for the nice case.
So I decided to leave this for the next iteration of the psu and in the meanwhile use the original box of the psu (its also quite small and nice) for a first iteration and still convert this into a nice lab bench psu (I somehow don’t like to leave the projects in half).

So, I’m currently planning to have -12, ground, 3.3v, 5v and 12v outputs, being the 3.3, 5 and 12v fused to 2 amps. 
In a secondary 5v output there will be a resistor (10ohm 10w, hopping its enough), since this psu needs some load on the 5v to boot. Just somehow have to figure how a way to put everything in that small space.
