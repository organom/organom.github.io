<p>Another weekend has passed and I decided to get rid or the ugly cables connecting the raspberry pi zero to the 3d printer.<br/>For this to go well (in one end because the tri-gorilla doesn&rsquo;t output power in the usb-B port and in the other because the raspberry had the connections on the opposite side that I wanted) I decided to solder the 4 wires directly to the raspberry pi zero (2nd pic) and in the other end I used a female usb-b (so that I can still disconnect the whole thing easily when needed),solder the data- and data+ to the tri-gorilla and the power I connected to the aux 5v &amp; gnd pins.</p>
<p>I would say the end result got pretty neat and now I&rsquo;m not afraid anymore to tune the camera direction when printing since it&rsquo;s not so easy to disconnect the cables anymore :P</p>
