<p>Been a long time since I last wrote, so I&rsquo;ll be posting what I&rsquo;ve been up to during the last months.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Starting with my much needed PC upgrade.</p>
<p>Needed to send the MacBook pro to fix (battery swallowing), so decided it was a good time to kill that dependency and start working with more powerful hardware on my day to day, with the idea of being quiet, no rgb nonsense, resilient and upgradable in case I required.</p>
<p>Some choices were also inspired a bit on Linus Torvalds choices, since I hope kernel support for this components become better with time ;)</p>
<p>Since I use Nvidia as graphical card and didn&rsquo;t want to change that, hackintosh was not an option. So I decided to give a try and move to PopOS, supported by system76. Quite happy with the system, outside of the inability to suspend with this hardware, need to invest more time to look into this but its sad and annoying because I thought linux had overcome this some years ago  (same behaviour on base ubuntu, so not PopOS fault)</p>
<p>What about iphone development, well, since ram and cpu are now abundant, I just created a VirtualBox machine for it. Works great (outside of the iPhone passthrough via usb, still didn&rsquo;t figure that out). But now that the MacBook is back,I have a fallback in case its needed.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve been using more and more VirtualBox for complete PoC setups (kubernetes, esxi, microk8s, openshift, etc) the 32gb start to get tight, glad I got 2x16gb, so easy to add 32 more if required :)</p>
<p> That&rsquo;s all for now, more coming soon</p>
