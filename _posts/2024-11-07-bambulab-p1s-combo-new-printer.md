After spending already so many hours printing with the Anycubic Kobra 3, I felt it was time to expand my little 3D printing corner with another machine

CoreXY printers have always been my favorite: compact, portable, and known for their solid build quality and ease of maintenance.

Since Anycubic doesnâ€™t currently offer a CoreXY option, I decided to explore the renowned BambuLab printers to see what all the buzz was about. After some research and price comparisons, I chose the P1S.

Since Anycubic doesn't have a CoreXY currently I've finally decided to give it a shot on a the famous BambuLab printers and see what it was all about. After some research and price comparisons I choose the P1S.

I have to admit, it has exceeded every expectation I had. 

The hype surrounding these printers is absolutely justified, they truly live up to the reputation.
The only downside? The lack of a filament dryer on the AMS, which would have been a great addition to an already impressive machine.
