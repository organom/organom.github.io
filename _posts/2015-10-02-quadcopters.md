A fascinating night yesterday at the lab. Outside from the awesome projects, 3d printing, electronic hacking and building, I managed to get [t4rwin](http://tmblr.co/m9dsmpSVheaOLiGJqqQ6feQ) old copter as my first approach to a self built quadcopter.Â

With a lot of help from master Liviu we made it work, crash (inside), work, crash (outside) and work again :D
Lots of more improvements planned for it already ;)
