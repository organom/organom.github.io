I was initially looking into buying a second hand Weller or similar branch, but it seems that’s what everyone aims to and I was not feeling like giving 80+ euros for a second hand no warranty oldie (not even 200€ for a new one :p).</p><p>I then started looking on what I could get from white brands and managed to get this nice one on ebay ( <a href="http://www.ebay.de/itm/351133171307?_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT">http://www.ebay.de/itm/351133171307?_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT</a> ) for 17,89€ with free shipping. The reviews were good around the 936 board, so I decided to risk it.</p><p>I have to say the quality is better than what I expected (for 17€) and it heats to the max temperature in about 30 seconds (perfect for an impatient guy like me). I already did some fast soldering and it doesn’t look that bad (for my lack of skill).</p><p>Until know I can definitely say I’m happy with the deal and lets just hope it last for some time ;)   </p>
