<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_nvcs6w23Hp1uv5ijyo1_1280.jpg"/><br/>Original psu fan, just inverted it to push the air in.
<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_nvcs6w23Hp1uv5ijyo2_1280.jpg"/><br/>2 fans mounted and hot glued to the back part to force the air out
<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_nvcs6w23Hp1uv5ijyo3_1280.jpg"/><br/>Used some wood that was laying around in order to fixate the button and connector.
<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_nvcs6w23Hp1uv5ijyo4_1280.jpg"/><br/>Left some space aside the button for it I want to install some more feature in the future (thinking maybe on some lights for soldering)
<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_nvcs6w23Hp1uv5ijyo5_1280.jpg"/><br/>Connect all the fans
<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_nvcs6w23Hp1uv5ijyo6_1280.jpg"/><br/>Some kind of filtering... yeah, i know... it was what I had lying around... better than nothing i would say :)
<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_nvcs6w23Hp1uv5ijyo10_1280.jpg"/><br/>Power female plug for connecting the external psu.
<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_nvcs6w23Hp1uv5ijyo7_1280.jpg"/><br/>Fully mounted front
<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_nvcs6w23Hp1uv5ijyo8_1280.jpg"/><br/>Fully mounted back with the 12v power supply.
<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_nvcs6w23Hp1uv5ijyo9_1280.jpg"/><br/>And it gets the job done :)<br/><p>Was in a urgent need of a smoke extractor after some late bad experiences with home soldering. So it was time to pick some parts I had lying around and make something useful out of them.</p><p>Nothing too sophisticated or perfect, but it gets the job done :)</p>
