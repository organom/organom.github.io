There was a cool mini-itx ion board (QuadCore Atom 1.6Ghz) laying around on the free to use area, and I had the aluminium case and the car psu (6-24v input) from my old chii module plus a 2 x HP 2Gb ddr2 800 ECC from my old pc laying around.</p><p>For now it was already tested with 3 printers working simultaneously and the hardware is barely being pushed.
