Moving my dry filament storage boxes around was becoming a hassle, so I decided to add wheels for easier mobility.

For this, I picked up a set of [STANDERS 360Âº 35mm 30kg](https://www.leroymerlin.pt/produtos/4-rodas-interior-standers-360-d35mm-30kg-82629488.html) wheels from my local Leroy Merlin.

To attach them without damaging my IKEA Samla 22L boxes, I remixed an existing 3D model ([view it here](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1097216)) to fit the wheels and secured them with double-sided tape for a firm hold.

The design is freely available on Tinkercad: [https://www.tinkercad.com/things/5Az2rYK8vI6-ikea-samla-22l-wheels](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/5Az2rYK8vI6-ikea-samla-22l-wheels)
The original Samla feet model I used for the remix was: [https://makerworld.com/models/529076](https://makerworld.com/models/529076)


On another note, I also received a fresh batch of filament from MakerOnline using my exchange points. Thank you, Anycubic! This should keep me stocked for a while. ðŸ˜Š
