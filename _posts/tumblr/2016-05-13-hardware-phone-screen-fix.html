The touch still worked, so I just ordered the replacement part and say, well, i’ll try a DIY on it :)<br/></p><p>Have to say that I was a bit scared on the expected quality from a 22€  screen+touch+frame (yes, went the lazy way to not have to unglue the screen). But got surprised by the positive, super professional packing, super fast deliver, and great build quality. I can’t really say anything bad from the product, I would even say the touch is more responsive than before. Need one, get it here: <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Lcd-display-Touch-screen-digitizer-with-frame-For-Huawei-Honor-4C-WHITE-BLACK-free-shipping/32450353430.html">http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Lcd-display-Touch-screen-digitizer-with-frame-For-Huawei-Honor-4C-WHITE-BLACK-free-shipping/32450353430.html</a></p><p>I took around 1 hour to change it (it was my very first time). I think it was much easier than unglueing the full screen for sure, but more hard than I had anticipated, since there are some components that need to be unglued from the original frame and moved to the new one. In the end all went  beautifully and 100% working :)</p>
