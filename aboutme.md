title: About me
---

My name is Ricardo Gomes (aka organom).

I love technology, researching, making prototypes and sharing ideas. I characterize myself as being friendly, passionate, spontaneous, dynamic, organized and a hardworking person that always strives for excellence.

Creating something new, specially if it can help someone, is my main motivation.

On my free time I enjoy building things (DIY), researching into new technologies, sharing knowledge and playing online games. I tend to be quite spontaneous about it and my attention is spread across a wide range of interests: Quadcopters, VR, 3d printing, IoT, Electronics, etc.

Joining hackathons & maker/DIY events is also something I enjoy doing from time to time

I keep track of my personal achievements in this page and my professional ones in LinkedIn.
