I was feeling a bit nostalgic, so I decided to dust off my RetroPie SNES controller for a spin. It had been sitting on the shelf for so long that RetroPie couldn't update anymore. 

I had to open it up, reflash the SD card with the latest version, and reconfigure everything from scratch. 
Fortunately, everything went smoothly, and nothing broke along the way! :)
