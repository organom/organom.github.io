deep water vegetable culture at home. Managed to find that cute vases that seem to fit my purpose and hold allot of small vegetables in a small space. Made some holes with a soldering iron and then the big question arrived: how to hold the vases to the box??  duct tape that sh***!!!   And it actually worked out better than expected :D</p><p>Now lets see them grow :D</p>
